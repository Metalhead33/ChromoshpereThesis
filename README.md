# ChromoshpereThesis
Source code for my application that I am developing for my college thesis.

The goal of this thesis is to develop an application that can automate the process is always the inevitable conclusion of every photographing frenzy – post-production, in other words, the act of selecting out identical and irredeemably low-quality photos _(and recommending them for deletion)_, improving the quality of low-quality photos, as well as combining multiple blurry  photos into one sharp photo.

The application will be called **ChromoSphere**, and its goal is to be available on both Android and PC devices – to this end, I will enlist the aid of the Qt framework.
